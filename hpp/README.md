### What is this?
These are header files containing relevant functions for large number arithmetic. They are derived from my earlier work in proper cpp files; which have not been modified since eleventh grade when I was new to C++.

Results may vary. Feel free to use these as reference or a starting point for your own work; this project has been abandoned since June 2015.
